## Task 2

Now that we have learned some basics of matplotlib,
we will now use pandas to import data from a **(name).csv file**,
and show data that way.

## Library
We will need ```pandas``` library to read data from file so to set up the
project you will open the terminal and install pandas:
```shell
pip install pandas
```

Now import it into file:

```python
import pandas as pd
```

Let's begin.
